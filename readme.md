# Building Deep learning models like ANN and CNN

The repository is categorized into building various models using deep learning

## Machine learning basics

This section contains intuition about the linear and logistic regression, data preprocessing template and classification template.

  #### Data preprocessing template
  ###### Libraries required:
    numpy
    pandas
    sklearn
  ###### Steps to be performed
    1. Import all the libraries
    2. Import the dataset
    3. replace the null values to the mean of other values
    4. Encode the categorical variables
    5. Split the dataset to train and test sets
    6. Feature scaling
