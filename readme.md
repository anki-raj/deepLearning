# Building Deep learning models like ANN and CNN

The repository is categorized into building various models using deep learning

## Machine learning basics

This section contains intuition about the linear and logistic regression, data preprocessing template and classification template.

  #### Data preprocessing template
  ###### Libraries required:
    numpy
    pandas
    sklearn
  ###### Steps to be performed
    1. Import all the libraries
    2. Import the dataset
    3. replace the NaN to the mean of other values
    4. Encode the categorical variables
