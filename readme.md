# Building Deep learning models

The repository is categorized into building various models using deep learning

## Artificial Neural Network Model

An ANN model is built to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank based on many independent attributes like salary, age, tenure etc.

### Libraries required
    Pandas
    Sklearn
    Keras - Using Tensorflow backend

### Steps to be followed
    Data preprocessing - Diving the dataset, categorical encoding, feature scaling
    Initialize the ANN - using sequencial() class.
    Add the input,hidden and output layer - using Dense() class.
    compile the ANN - Used stochastic gradient descent
    Train it on the train data set.
    test it on the test data set.
    Find the accuracy using confusion matrix

### Final Accuracy Achieved : 86.5%
